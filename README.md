## Summary 

Splunk UBA denies and allows by default.

1. Denied domains: 
- Splunk UBA includes a list of high-confidence entries from the Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF). New entries are periodically added to the list in new versions of Splunk UBA.
2. Denied IP addresses:
-	Splunk UBA does not include a default set of denied IP addresses.
3. Allowed domains
- Splunk UBA selects allowed domains from the top 250,000 global website domain names according to Alexa.
4. Allowed IP addresses
- Splunk UBA selects allowed IP addresses from the top 50,000 global website IP addresses and ranges according to Alexa.
5. Allowed users
- Splunk UBA does not include a default set of allowed users. Add HR data to Splunk UBA before uploading a list of allowed users.

Add a domain or IP address to a deny list to generate anomalies whenever a user or device interacts with that domain or IP address.

- Interaction with a denied domain generates a Blacklisted Domain anomaly.
- Interaction with a denied IP generates a Blacklisted IP Address anomaly.

### Instructions on how to add new entries to a deny list or allow list with gist
** These instructions are used for demo purposes only and uses a public gist. 

1. Create a Gist: Github -> Navigate to gist home page -> Create a public gist
